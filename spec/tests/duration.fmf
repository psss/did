summary: Maximum time for test execution

story:
    As a test harness I need to know after how long time I should
    kill test if it is still running to prevent resource wasting.

description:
    In order to prevent stuck tests consuming resources we define a
    maximum time for test execution. If the limit is exceeded the
    running test is killed by the test harness. Use the same
    format as the ``sleep`` command. Should be a ``string``. The
    default value is ``5m``.

example: |
    duration: 3m
    duration: 2h
    duration: 1d

implemented: /tmt/base
tested:
  - /tests/discover/duration
  - /tests/execute/duration
