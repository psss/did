summary: Filesystem directory to be entered before executing the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to define two virtual test cases, both
    using the same script for executing.

description:
    As the object hierarchy does not need to copy the filesystem
    structure (e.g. when using virtual test cases) we need a way
    how to define where the test is located.

    Automation is expected to change directory to provided path
    starting from the fmf tree root directory before executing the
    test. Use a ``string`` containing an absolute path starting
    with slash. If path is not defined, the directory where the
    test metadata are stored is used by default.

example: |
    path: /protocols/https
