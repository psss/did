=====================

This is **did**, a command line tool which will help you to easily
gather data for your weekly, monthly or yearly reports. It suports
plugins for various data sources such as git, trac, wiki, bugzilla
and more. It can be used to gather stats for a single user as well
as for the whole team and merging them together. It saves you from
that boring stuff of making notes and later putting them together.
