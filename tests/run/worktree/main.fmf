summary: Check whether worktree is correctly set
description:
    For the `prepare` and `finish` steps, the current working
    directory must be set to the metadata tree root for best user
    experience. Also tests defined directly in the plan (under the
    `discover` or `execute` step) should be executed there.

    By default tested in a `container`, for pull requests also
    against `local` and during `full` testing using `virtual` as
    well.
