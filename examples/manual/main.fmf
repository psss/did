    Example demonstrates using MarkDown with defined structure to
    describe manual test actions necessary for its execution.
    Adhering to its structure allows export to other formats or
    services. Note that any sections may contain shell script
    code which could be used for semi-automated execution in the
    future.
manual: true

/mini:
    summary: Minimal manual test
    test: mini.md

/full:
    summary: Longer manual test
    test: full.md
